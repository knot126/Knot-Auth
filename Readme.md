# Knot Auth

**Knot Auth** is an authientication service and protocol. It's not meant for serious projects and is just for me to play with making my own authientication system.

This is not nessicarially a secure project. For example, if the registered app uses the "get_with_qs" method for recieving the user's grant ID and grant key for that app, anyone with the URL can just know and do some actions as that user.
